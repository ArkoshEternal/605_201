[?2004lWelcome to Guess That Number!
The game where for some reason you you give me a range of numbers and a number of guesses, and I generate a number for you to guess.
If you guess the number, you win! If you don't, you lose. It's that simple.
Let's get started!

How many guesses would you like to have? Guesses: 
2
What is the maximum number you would like to guess? Maximum Number: 
10
I have generated a number between 1 and 10. What is your guess?
4
too low
3
too low
You have run out of guesses. The number was 9
Would you like to play again? (yes/no)
