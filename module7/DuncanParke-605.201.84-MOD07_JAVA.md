# Module Six - Assignment Submission

## The Assignment

> This assignment will use the Employee class that you developed for 
> assignment 6. Design two sub-classes of Employee...SalariedEmployee and 
> HourlyEmployee. A salaried employee has an annual salary attribute. An 
> hourly employee has an hourly pay rate attribute, an hours worked 
> attribute, and an earnings attribute. An hourly employee that works more 
> than 40 hours in a week gets paid at 1.5 times their hourly pay rate for the 
> hours over 40 hours. You will decide how to implement constructors, 
> getters, setters, and any other methods that might be necessary.
> 1. Draw a UML diagram for the classes.
> 2. Implement the classes, and write a test program that creates a 
> salaried employee and two hourly employees. One of the hourly 
> employees should have hours worked set to less than 40 and one 
> should have hours worked set to more than 40. The test program 
> should display all attributes for the three employees. To keep 
> things simple, the employee classes donâ€™t need to do any editing.

## Design

Straightforward implementation again. I cleaned up some of the style issues I had in module 6. 

No real noted on design here, other than my choice to use a double for salary so we can do penny denominations, which does assume an American/Euro employee with 2 decimals max of hourly/salary monetary value.

## Implementation 

``` java
package module7;

// Class which implements the test of the employees

public class testEmployee {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a salaried employee
        salariedEmployee salariedEmployee = new salariedEmployee(
            new name("John", "Doe"),
            new address("123 Main St", "Baltimore", "CA", 21218),
            new date(1, 1, 1975),
            1,
            50000
        );

        // Create two hourly employees
        hourlyEmployee hourlyEmployee1 = new hourlyEmployee(
            new name("Jane", "Smith"),
            new address("456 Oak St", "Boston", "MA", 67890),
            new date(2, 2, 1975),
            2,
            20,
            35
        );

        hourlyEmployee hourlyEmployee2 = new hourlyEmployee(
            new name("Bob", "Johnson"),
            new address("789 Pine St", "Watertown", "FL", 11223),
            new date(3, 3, 1975),
            3,
            20,
            45
        );

        // Display attributes for the salaried employee
