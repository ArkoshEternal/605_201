/** getStartDay
    * The method getStartDay() implements Zeller's Algorithm for determining the
    * day of the week the first day of a month is. The method adjusts Zeller's
    * numbering scheme for day of week ( 0=Saturday, ..., 6=Friday ) to conform
    * to day of week number that corresponds to ISO conventions (i.e.,
    * 1=Monday, ..., 7=Sunday)
    *
    * Pre-Conditions: The month value, m, is 1-12 The day value, d, is 1-31, or
    * 1-28, 1-29 for February The year value, y, is the full year (e.g., 2012)
    *
    * Post-Conditions: A value of 1-7 is returned, representing the first day of
    * the month 1 = Monday, ..., 7 = Sunday
    *

    *
    * @param month
    * @param year
    * @return dayNum (1 = Mon, ... , 7 = Sun )
    *
    * precondition: month, year, and day are integer types
